THIS IS A VERY ROUGH DRAFT OF WHAT WILL BE HERE

- **Write however little or as much as you want** 
	- *Ideally* a 200 word paragraph, but keep in mind:
		- Write more = Potentially more character spotlight
		- Write less = Potentially less character spotlight
- **That said, *please* include the following**:
	- ***Catalyst***: What made your character become an adventurer?
		- i.e. *A successful merchant who is in a happy relationship would be very unlikely to leave that behind to dungeon delve*
	- ***NPCs***: 1-2 (or more) as detailed as you want, someone to possibly include in the story in some way
		- Could be just a name and one sentence description
		- Less detailed = more creative liberty for me 
	- ***Character Goal***: One, clear goal that your character feels compelled to complete, and that can be definitively determined if it has been achieved or not.
		- *i.e. find my father, decipher the tome left to me, recover memories*
	- ***(Optional) Character Motivation***: Gold? Power? Adventure? Love? Renown? Knowledge? Altruism? Redemption? Survival?
